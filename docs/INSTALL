== VDrift for Linux ==

- Dependencies -
Libraries
You must have libsdl (http://www.libsdl.org/), libsdl-image, libsdl-net,
libopenal (http://openal.org/) or libfmod (http://fmod.org/), and the
OpenGL libraries installed to play VDrift. To compile, you must also have
the headers (usually the -dev packages, consult your distro's docs) for
these libraries.

The default sound library used by VDrift is OpenAL. FMOD is also supplied
in the Linux release as libfmod-3.74.so. See "FAQ: How to enable FMOD?" if
you'd like to use it. VDrift has not been tested with OpenAL 1.1, only
1.0.

Build Tools
To compile VDrift, you'll also need gcc (http://gcc.gnu.org/), and
optionally SCons (http://www.scons.org/).


- Installation -
Make sure your computer's hardware meets the requirements for the game (see
"FAQ: What are the hardware requirements to play VDrift?" for more info).

Make sure you have all the required libraries and build tools (see "FAQ:
What software is required to compile VDrift for Linux?" for more info).

As of the 2005-11-03 release, VDrift is available as both a source package
and a binary package.

** VDrift Binary Package **
Download (http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=137283)
the latest VDrift Linux binary package and unpack it. In this package you
might find the files and directories:

vdrift-release-bin/vdrift
vdrift-release-bin/vdrift-install.sh
vdrift-release-bin/docs/
vdrift-release-bin/data/

Change directories to the vdrift directory (whatever it is called). From
there, you can either run VDrift from here or you can install it
system-wide. To run VDrift right now, use:

./vdrift

To install VDrift to a system directory use the script
./vdrift-install.sh. This script installs the VDrift binary and data into
the proper places. Make sure you run it as a root-level user.

Usage:
./vdrift-install.sh /path/to/vdrift/binary /path/to/vdrift/data

Example:
./vdrift-install.sh /usr/games/bin /usr/share/games/vdrift

Here the vdrift exectuable will be /usr/games/bin/vdrift and the data will
go
in /usr/share/games/vdrift. Make sure that the binary directory is in your
PATH.

** VDrift Source Package **
Download (http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=137283)
the latest VDrift Linux source package and unpack it. All the files in the
package are in a directory called vdrift-[version]-src where [version] is
something like 2005-10-02. We'll just refer to the directory name as
"vdrift" for simplicity.

As of the 2005-10-02 release, VDrift no longer uses ./configure, make,
etc. (autotools). Now the project is built with SCons
(http://www.scons.org/) which is written in Python and makes much better
sense than autotools in many ways.

There are two ways to use scons. The first way is to install scons on your
system, then you can use it simply by the name of the program, "scons". The
second way is to use the scons-local package (included with VDrift) which
will do the same thing but doesn't require that you install scons on your
system. In this case you use the "./scons.py" command instead of "scons".

So, of course first unpack the vdrift archive, then enter the directory it
creates. After that, if you need scons-local unpack it from the
tools/scons-local-0.96.1.tar.gz file. If you don't need scons-local
proceed with compiling.

Example, with SCons already installed:

tar jxvf vdrift-2005-10-02-src.tar.bz2
cd vdrift-2005-10-02-src
scons
su
scons install
exit
vdrift


Example, without SCons installed, using scons-local:

tar jxvf vdrift-2005-10-02-src.tar.bz2
cd vdrift-2005-10-02-src
tar zxvf tools/scons-local-0.96.1.tar.gz
./scons.py
su
./scons.py install
exit
vdrift



The default directories for VDrift to be installed in are as follows:
bin: /usr/games
prefix: /usr/share/games/vdrift
settings: .vdrift

To change these settings specify the new value when running scons or
./scons.py. The system is intended to remember option values even if only
specified once, but unfortunately due to some bug it doesn't, so you must
specify the options each time, like this:

scons bin=/usr/local/bin prefix=/usr/local/games/vdrift
su
scons install bin=/usr/local/bin prefix=/usr/local/games/vdrift


This will compile VDrift and install the executable at
/usr/local/bin/vdrift, while the VDrift data will go in
/usr/local/games/vdrift/.

If you'd like to use the FMOD sound library, see "FAQ: How to enable
FMOD?".

For more information about the build system see "FAQ: How to use SCons?"


== VDrift for OS X ==

- Installation -
OS X support will be in the next version.

OS X binaries
These will be released with the next version.

Compiling from source
Download the latest source version of VDrift that supports OS X. Currently
this is in SVN but has not been released. Use the XCode project files in
the tools/osx/ directory.


== VDrift for Windows ==

- Installation -
First, make sure your computer's hardware meets the requirements for the
game (see "FAQ: What are the hardware requirements to play VDrift?" for
more info). Then, download
(http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=137283) the latest
release of the VDrift win32 binary package and unzip it using your
favorite unzipping tool. This will create a new directory called VDrift.
In this directory, you will find vdrift.exe, which you can then run.

A proper Windows installer is coming in a future release.
